# Game Olympus

## Overview

**"Game Olympus"** - A relationship-driven visual novel game that puts players in the role of a customizable deity navigating modern Olympian society. Here "Episode" meets "Choices" but with the sophisticated storytelling and visual style lightly inspired of popular webtoon named Lore Olympus.

## Game Description

### Core Mechanics

- **Choice-consequence narrative system** where decisions affect character relationships, story outcomes, and divine political standing
- **Relationship management** with trust meters, romance levels, and friendship dynamics across 15+ characters
- **Dual-realm exploration** - switch between modern Olympus (corporate/social) and ancient domains (mythological/magical)
- **Character progression** through emotional growth rather than stats - unlock new dialogue, powers, and story branches
- **Divine responsibility mini-games** - manage workers, mediate godly disputes, handle mortal realm crises

## Core Game Loop

### Weekly Cycle

- **New Episode Release** (45-60 minutes of content) with major story progression
- **Daily Relationship Maintenance** - send messages, make small choices, manage divine duties
- **Social Discovery** - explore Olympus, meet characters, participate in events
- **Choice Consequences** - see how previous decisions affect current relationships and opportunities

### Session Loop (20-30 minutes)

- **Story Progression** - advance main narrative through dialogue choices
- **Character Interaction** - build/maintain relationships through conversation trees
- **Divine Management** - handle responsibility mini-games that affect story
- **Customization** - outfit selection and character development that impacts next session

### Engagement Hooks

- **Cliffhanger episodes** that drive weekly return
- **Daily relationship notifications** and choice opportunities
- **Limited-time events** tied to character birthdays/mythological holidays
- **Community features** for sharing story outcomes and theories

## Success Idea

The game succeeds by making players feel they're living in the ancient greek god universe rather than just reading it, with meaningful choices that create personalized romantic and dramatic storylines.
